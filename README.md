# Panel-method-for-NACA-airfoils
Code discretises airfoil into linear panels and utilizes the source/vortex method to calculate the pressure distribution and model the flow around the airfoil.
User inputs the shape of the airfoil as a .dat file and values for the freestream velocity and angle of attack.
The mathematical background of the code relies heavily on fluid mechanics and aerodynamics, particularly on potential flow theory.
Code calculates the pressure coefficient at each point on the airfoil and plots the respective distribution.
Subsequently it constructs the velocity field of the flow around the airfoil.
